    <p>Zbigniew Braniecki is a social activist, software engineer and sociologist who works on the intersection between code and people. He started early as a webdev, got into web tools in the year 2000 as a co-author of a famous Polish Alladyn JS library, and after working on backends and frontends of all kinds he took the leap into shaping up the web browser space founding <a href="http://aviary.pl/">Aviary.pl</a> team, joining Mozilla Europe and the Flock project where he spent a few years building a new open source social-oriented web browser. Finally, he decided to get closer to his project of choice, and accepted a position at Mozilla where he holds a "Community Ninja" title these days.</p>

    <p>Originally a student in informatics, mathematics, and digital signal processing, Christian has spent his professional career specializing in web and front-end development with technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML using agile practices.</p><p>After working on several projects with less than trivial amounts of JavaScript, Christian has felt the pain of developing ``the cowboy style''. In an attempt at improving code quality, confidence and the ability to modify and maintain code with greater ease he has spent a great deal of his time both at work and in his spare time over the last few years investigating unit testing and test driven development in JavaScript. Being a sworn TDD-er while developing in traditional server-side languages, the cowboy style JavaScript approach wasn't cutting it anymore. The culmination of this passion is the book "Test-Driven JavaScript Development", out on Addison-Wesley September 2010.</p>
    
    <h3 class="page__title speakers__item__topic">TDD/JavaScript testing</h3>
    
    <p>In this workshop we will learn how test-driven development can help you write leaner code, tighten your focus and help juggle the requirements to your system. We will write a bunch of unit tests and learn what separates good unit tests from bad ones, and how to test every aspect of browser-scripting.</p><ul><li>How to write good unit tests</li><li>Tools to improve your workflow</li><li>Code katas for learning and practicing TDD</li><li>TDD and browser-based applications</li></ul><p>The workshop will provide several practical labs for the participants, so bring your laptops.</p>

    <h3 class="speakers__item__topic">Desktop applications with Javascript</h3>
    
    <p>In this workshop you'll learn how to use web technologies such as JavaScript or CSS3 to create powerful desktop applications and run them on Windows, Linux &amp; MacOsX. JavaScript is now a step ahead than just being interpreted by the browser. Using custom runtime environments provided by Mozilla you can create real applications that can access local file system, have full network access, use databse storage (SQLite), integrate with System Tray (or Dock on MacOsX) or use other features not available to web applications. So take your laptops and prepare for moving your Javascripts to the desktops!</p>
